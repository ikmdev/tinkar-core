/**
 * Annotation to define the fully qualified name associated with a concept bound to a Java type.
 *
 * This annotation is used to specify a single fully qualified name, represented as
 * a string, that uniquely identifies the associated concept or entity within a system.
 * The fully qualified name is typically a descriptive name or identifier
 * defined in the context of the system.
 *
 * Target: This annotation is applied at type level (classes or interfaces),
 * associating the fully qualified name to the annotated type.
 *
 * Retention Policy: This annotation is retained at runtime, allowing
 * the fully qualified name to be accessed and processed using reflection-based methods.
 *
 * Usage: This annotation is generally used in systems where types need
 * to be associated or identified by their specific fully qualified names
 * for purposes such as dynamic type resolution, entity identification, or
 * mapping contextual definitions to Java types.
