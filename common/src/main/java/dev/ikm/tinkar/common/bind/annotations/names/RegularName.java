/**
 * Annotation to specify a collection of regular names associated with a Concept bound to a Java type.
 *
 * Names for concepts follow the SNOMED convention described here:
 * https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCECL/Appendix+C+-+Dialect+Aliases
 *
 * This annotation allows defining a set of descriptive names or labels
 * for a concept or entity that may serve as identifiers, aliases,
 * or commonly used terminologies. These names can represent a concept
 * semantically and be leveraged in reflection-based operations or user interfaces.
 *
 * Target: This annotation is applicable at the type level (e.g., classes or interfaces),
 * binding the regular names to the annotated type.
 *
 * Retention Policy: This annotation is retained at runtime, enabling runtime
 * access and processing of the names via reflection.
 *
 * Expected Use Case: Applied to classes or interfaces that represent a specific
 * concept, where the retrieval of its regular names is an integral part of its
 * semantic definition.
 *
 * The values provided must be valid strings and are represented as an array
 * of strings in the annotation's value().
