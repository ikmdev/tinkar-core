/**
 * Generally available thread pools for doing background processing in an ISAAC application.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #forkJoinThreadPool()} that this provides is identical to the @{link {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()}
 * with the exception that it will bottom out at 6 processing threads, rather than 1, to help prevent
 * deadlock situations in common ISAAC usage patterns.  This has an unbounded queue depth, and LIFO behavior.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #blockingThreadPool()} that this provides is a standard thread pool with (up to) the same number of threads
 * as there are cores present on the computer - with a minimum of 6 threads.  This executor has no queue - internally
 * it uses a {@link SynchronousQueue} - so if no thread is available to accept the task being queued, it will block
 * submission of the task until a thread is available to accept the job.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #threadPool()} that this provides is a standard thread pool with (up to) the same number of threads
 * as there are cores present on the computer - with a minimum of 6 threads.  This executor has an unbounded queue
 * depth, and FIFO behavior.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #ioThreadPool()} that this provides is a standard thread pool with 6 threads.  This executor has an unbounded queue
 * depth, and FIFO behavior.  This executor is good for jobs that tend to block on disk IO, where you don't want many running in parallel.
